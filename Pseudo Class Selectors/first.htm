    <p id="one">Konidela Pawan Kalyan[5] (born Konidela Sri Kalyan Kumar;[8] 2 September 1971)[2] is an Indian politician and actor, serving as the 11th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forest, Science and Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh as MLA representing the Pithapuram constituency.[3] He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party</p>

    <p id="two">As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following."[12] He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[13][18] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades..</p>
    <p>Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.[9][11] In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.[22] Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.[24] He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Both Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi held the record for the highest-grossing Telugu film of its era.[25]</p>
<p id="last">Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana.[46] It was produced by Allu Aravind under Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign prior to its release. Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest.[47] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.[46] Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention.[48]

His second film Gokulamlo Seeta (1997), a drama film released the following year.[49] It was directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and starred Kalyan alongside Raasi and Harish. In the film, Kalyan plays a spoiled rich youth who transforms his reckless ways and fights against societal and familial opposition to win his love. Gokulamlo Seeta was the first film where Kalyan was credited as 'Pawan Kalyan' after he was awarded the title "Pawan" in March 1997.[50] It was a commercial success.[51]

Kalyan's third film was Suswagatham (1998) directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao and produced by R. B. Choudary under the Super Good Films banner. It starred Kalyan and Devayani (in her Telugu debut), with music composed by S. A. Rajkumar.[46] Kalyan was first credited with the title Power Star in this film.[49][52] In the film, Kalyan played a young man who loses everything due to his blind love for a girl. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. Suswagatham sowed the seeds for Kalyan's rise to stardom. The film became a super hit at the box office.[51]

1998–2001: Success streak and stardom
Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by A. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[53] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[54] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001).[55]
